                Inventory represents a significant portion of working capital for most manufacturing and trading businesses. Too much inventory ties up cash; too little causes stockouts and lost sales. This comprehensive guide covers proven techniques to optimize your inventory levels in 2025.
              </p>

              <h2>Understanding the True Cost of Inventory</h2>
              <p>
                Many businesses focus only on purchase price, but carrying inventory has multiple cost components:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Capital cost:</strong> Interest on money tied up in inventory (typically 8-12% annually)</li>
                <li><strong>Storage cost:</strong> Warehouse rent, utilities, insurance</li>
                <li><strong>Handling cost:</strong> Labor for receiving, putaway, picking, and counting</li>
                <li><strong>Obsolescence risk:</strong> Products becoming outdated or expired</li>
                <li><strong>Shrinkage:</strong> Loss due to theft, damage, or counting errors</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Total carrying cost typically ranges from 20-30% of inventory value annually. A business with ₹1 crore in inventory is spending ₹20-30 lakhs per year just to hold it!
              </p>

              <h2>ABC Analysis: Focus on What Matters</h2>
              <p>
                Not all inventory items deserve equal attention. ABC analysis categorizes items by importance:
              </p>
              
              <h3>A Items (High Value, Low Quantity)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Typically 20% of items representing 80% of inventory value</li>
                <li>Deserve daily monitoring and tight control</li>
                <li>Use precise demand forecasting</li>
                <li>Consider consignment or vendor-managed inventory</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>B Items (Moderate Value and Quantity)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>30% of items representing 15% of value</li>
                <li>Review weekly or bi-weekly</li>
                <li>Use standard reorder point systems</li>
                <li>Balance between cost and service level</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>C Items (Low Value, High Quantity)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>50% of items representing 5% of value</li>
                <li>Order in bulk to reduce transaction costs</li>
                <li>Review monthly or quarterly</li>
                <li>Simpler controls acceptable</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                A Delhi-based distributor reduced inventory carrying costs by 22% by applying ABC analysis and adjusting their purchasing strategies for each category.
              </p>

              <h2>Setting Optimal Reorder Points</h2>
              <p>
                The reorder point is when you trigger a new purchase order. Calculate it using:
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage × Lead Time) + Safety Stock</strong>
              </p>

              <h3>Determining Safety Stock</h3>
              <p>
                Safety stock protects against demand variability and supply delays:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Critical items:</strong> Higher safety stock (15-30 days)</li>
                <li><strong>Standard items:</strong> Moderate safety stock (7-14 days)</li>
                <li><strong>Easily sourced items:</strong> Minimal safety stock (3-7 days)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Modern ERP systems calculate optimal safety stock using statistical methods, considering demand variability and desired service levels.
              </p>

              <h2>Demand Forecasting Techniques</h2>
              <p>
                Accurate forecasting is the foundation of good inventory management:
              </p>

              <h3>1. Moving Average</h3>
              <p>
                Simple but effective for stable demand patterns. Calculate average of last 3-6 months and use as next month's forecast.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Weighted Moving Average</h3>
              <p>
                Give more weight to recent periods to respond faster to trends:
                <br />Recent month: 50%, Previous month: 30%, Two months ago: 20%
              </p>

              <h3>3. Seasonal Forecasting</h3>
              <p>
                For products with seasonal patterns, compare to same period last year with adjustments for growth.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Customer Order-Based Forecasting</h3>
              <p>
                Use confirmed orders and customer forecasts where available for more accurate planning.
              </p>

              <h2>Just-in-Time (JIT) vs. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)</h2>
              
              <h3>EOQ Model</h3>
              <p>
                Find the order quantity that minimizes total cost:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Best for items with steady demand</li>
                <li>Balances ordering costs vs. holding costs</li>
                <li>Results in moderate inventory levels</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>JIT Approach</h3>
              <p>
                Minimize inventory by synchronizing deliveries with usage:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Requires reliable suppliers and stable demand</li>
                <li>Reduces holding costs dramatically</li>
                <li>Higher risk of stockouts if supply disrupted</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Most successful companies use a hybrid: JIT for A items from reliable suppliers, EOQ for B items, and bulk buying for C items.
              </p>

              <h2>Cycle Counting: Continuous Accuracy</h2>
              <p>
                Replace annual physical counts with continuous cycle counting:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>A items:</strong> Count monthly</li>
                <li><strong>B items:</strong> Count quarterly</li>
                <li><strong>C items:</strong> Count annually</li>
                <li><strong>High-movement items:</strong> Count after major transactions</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Cycle counting maintains inventory accuracy year-round and identifies process issues before they become major problems.
              </p>

              <h2>Technology Enablers</h2>
              
              <h3>Barcode Scanning</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Eliminate data entry errors</li>
                <li>Speed up receiving and picking</li>
                <li>Enable real-time inventory updates</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Automated Alerts</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Low stock warnings before stockouts occur</li>
                <li>Excess stock alerts to prevent overordering</li>
                <li>Slow-moving inventory reports to reduce obsolescence</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Mobile Access</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Real-time stock queries from anywhere</li>
                <li>Mobile picking and putaway</li>
                <li>Inventory adjustments on the spot</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h2>
              <p>
                Track these metrics to measure inventory management effectiveness:
              </p>

              <h3>1. Inventory Turnover Ratio</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average Inventory</strong>
                <br />Target: 6-12 turns per year for most businesses
              </p>

              <h3>2. Days Inventory Outstanding</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>365 ÷ Inventory Turnover</strong>
                <br />Lower is generally better, but balance with service levels
              </p>

              <h3>3. Stock-Out Rate</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Number of times out of stock ÷ Total replenishment opportunities</strong>
                <br />Target: Less than 2%
              </p>

              <h3>4. Inventory Accuracy</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Items counted correctly ÷ Total items counted</strong>
                <br />Target: 95% or higher
              </p>

              <h3>5. Obsolete Inventory %</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Obsolete inventory value ÷ Total inventory value</strong>
                <br />Target: Less than 5%
              </p>

              <h2>Action Plan for 2025</h2>
              <p>
